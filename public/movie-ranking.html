<h1>The Best Movies According To Mike</h1>
<h2>My best 3 movies of all-time,</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Top Gun: Maverick</h3>
<p>This film is jammed pack with action and adventure. This film was the most anticipated film for myself as I watched the orginal Top Gun many times as a kid.</p>

<h3>Extraction 2</h3>
<p> This film is jammed pack with action. It reminds me of a mix between John Wick and Mission Impossible.</p>


<h3>Despicable Me</h3>
<p>This film holds sentimental value as it was my son's favourite movie when he was younger. It has alot of comedy and won't disappoint with making you laugh.</p>
